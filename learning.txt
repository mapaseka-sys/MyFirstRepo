What I have learned from this course

The lesson of this task is to teach you the foundational skills of using Git and GitHub, which are essential for collaborating on coding and software projects. This is often the first step in becoming proficient with version control and working in modern software development environments.

ðŸ”‘ Key Lessons from Each Part
0. Create and Manage Your First Repository
What you learn:

How to create a GitHub account and public repository

How to create files and commit them to GitHub

How to write meaningful commit messages

How to view your commit history

Why it's important:
This helps you get comfortable with the GitHub interface and the concept of version control (tracking changes in files over time).

1. Working With Branches and Making Pull Requests
What you learn:

How to create and work in a branch

How to create a pull request (PR) and review changes

How to merge changes into the main branch

Why it's important:
In real projects, branches let developers work independently on new features or fixes. Pull requests are used for code review and collaboration before merging into the main project.

2. Collaborating via Forking and Pull Requests
What you learn:

How to fork someone else's repository (make a copy)

How to make contributions and submit a pull request back to the original repository

Why it's important:
Forking is how you contribute to open-source projects. This part teaches you how to collaborate with others outside your own repo.

3. Cloning, Editing Locally, and Syncing Changes
What you learn:

How to clone a repository to your local machine

How to make changes locally and commit them using Git commands

How to push those changes back to GitHub

Why it's important:
This introduces the full development workflow â€” from working locally on your computer to syncing with GitHub. These skills are used every day in real-world development.
